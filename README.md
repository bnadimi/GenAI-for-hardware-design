This research is focused on advancing Large Language Models for Electronic Design Automation. 
This work explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and hardware design, developing novel approaches to automate and enhance various aspects of digital circuit design and verification.

This research addresses critical challenges in EDA by leveraging the power of Large Language Models to automate complex hardware design tasks. 
The work spans from fundamental code generation to advanced verification methodologies, creating a comprehensive ecosystem for AI-assisted hardware design.

Currently, we are exploring the following topics: 

- **Testbench Generation**  ---  Developing automated systems for generating comprehensive testbenches that ensure thorough verification of generated RTL designs. This work focuses on creating intelligent test scenarios that cover edge cases and functional verification requirements.

- **SVA (SystemVerilog Assertions) Generation** --- Creating automated tools for generating SystemVerilog Assertions to enhance verification coverage and design reliability. This project addresses the critical need for formal verification in modern hardware design workflows.
  
- **Evaluation Platform with Enhanced Complexity Levels** --- Building a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses RTL code generation across multiple complexity dimensions, providing more granular and meaningful metrics for comparing different LLM approaches in hardware design tasks.
